# Getting Started with Webapp-Temperature
## About The Project

Webapp-Temperature is a secure and interactive web to predict temperature based on Regression model, designed with [DL4J](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j) which trained with 300k+ data, produces high accuracy prediction. Registering is more secure with email activation features to MailDev. Our Dashboard provides dynamic graphical charts and tabulation data, easy to use for everyone. Upload large CSV file with a simple click and analysis is ready.\

This project was built with [React Js](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you need to run:

1. ### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
This will be frontend UI to browse the app.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

2. ### `backend-webapp`
Run the Spring-Boot from IntelliJ.\
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in your browser.\
Open [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console) to view h2-database in browser.

3. ### `maildev`
Install and run MailDev from CMD to get email verification after account registration.
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:1080](http://localhost:1080) to view it in your browser.

## Also
### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
